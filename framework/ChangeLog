Release 0.2.6

* Nov 17 2000 hship

Fix typo in exception message for unreferenced components.
Fix bug in ImageButton that caused it to be confused about which ImageButton was clicked if
a form contains more than one.
Cache ExternalAssets in the PageSource (as with FieldBinding and StaticBinding),
so that duplicate external assets will be represented only once.  This is useful when
a commonly used component (such as a border) is used on multiple pages.

* Nov 13 2000 hship

Allow static bindings to be pooled the same as field bindings.
Make the Rollover component only emit a "name" attribute if it is dynamic

component specifications.  It now encodes the currency page as well.
Fix some Javadoc errors.

* Nov 1 2000 hship

Merge PrimixFoundation into Tapestry.  Keeping them seperate had little value.
Change EnumPropertySelectionModel to require that the ResourceBundle be passed in
(since it can't always resolve the bundle, due to classloader issues).
Switch over to Servlet 2.2 APIs.

* Oct 25 2000 hship

Make some overdue documentation updates.

* Oct 24 2000 hship

Implemented caching of FieldBindings.
Make sure the page is identified in a RequestCycleException, if a runtime exception
is thrown during rewindPage().

Implemented the <field-binding> element of the specification.  Allows a binding to
be expressed in terms of a Java class and a static field of that class.
Move the canonical Tapestry DTD to the tapestry.sourceforge.net website.

* Oct 13 2000 hship

Reorganized how Body and Rollover components work together, slightly, so that less Javascript

* Oct 11 2000 hship

Change the interface for IPage and IComponent to allow a no-arguments constructor, and deprecate

to the form and its elements.

* Oct 5 2000 hship

Minor documentation and JWC errors in the TextField component.

* Oct 4 2000 hship

Fix a NullPointerException in SimpleApplication.cleanupAfterRequest().  The exception may be thrown
if another exception is thrown earlier in the request cycle (before any page recoders are accessed).

* Oct 4 2000 hship

Revise Submit and ImageButton components to set a property if clicked, remove
listener parameters from Form-related components.

* Sep 24 2000 hship

More Javadoc for ShowInspector component.

* Sep 12 2000 hship

Beef up the ShowInspector component, adding default images and rollover images, and
add parameters to allow those to be overriden.
Remove the Java Source tab from the Inspector ... turns out that shipping Java code in the
Tapestry framework confuses the Java compiler when compiling projects that depend on
the Tapestry framework.

* Sep 11 2000 hship

Add a Java Code tab to the Inspector.
Ship Java code for components and pages as resources.

* Sep 11 2000 hship

Added provisional image graphics for the Inspector.
Update the documentation to mention the Inspector.
Revise PropertySelection, adding the IPropertySelectionRenderer interface
and two implementation (SelectPropertySelectionRenderer and RadioPropertySelectionRenderer).
Generate a better exception message when EnumPropertySelectionModel can't find a ResourceBundle.
