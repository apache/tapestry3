Minor documentation and JWC errors in the TextField component.

* Oct 4 2000 hship

* Oct 4 2000 hship

Revise Submit and ImageButton components to set a property if clicked, remove
listener parameters from Form-related components.

* Sep 12 2000 hship

Beef up the ShowInspector component, adding default images and rollover images, and
