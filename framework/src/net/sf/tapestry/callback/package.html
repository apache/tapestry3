<title>Tapestry: Web Application Framework</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Provides implementations of callbacks, objects that encapsulate a server request that is deferred,
typically to allow a user to login or otherwise authenticate before proceeding with
some other activity.

<p>In practice, an implementation of {@link net.sf.tapestry.IPage#validate(IRequestCycle)} or
{@link net.sf.tapestry.IDirectListener} will create a callback, and assign it as a
persistent page property of an application-specific login page.  After the login completes, it 
can use the callback to return the user to the functionality that was deferred.

<p>Another example use would be to collect billing and shipping information as part of
an e-commerce site's checkout wizard.
