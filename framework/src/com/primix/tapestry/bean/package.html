<p>Implementation of the {@link com.primix.tapestry.IBeanProvider} interface, which is central
to the concept of helper beans.  Helper beans allow a components functionality to be extended using
aggregation; it can define certain JavaBeans to which behavior can be delegated.  
These beans have various lifecycles.

<p>In addition, the {@link BeanProviderHelper} allows access to the beans by name as if the beans
were properties of the provider -- even when the beans is instantiated as needed.

<p>Most helper beans will implement the {@link com.primix.tapestry.util.prop.IPoolable} interface; those
that do are pooled so that they can be shared between pages, sessions, etc.
