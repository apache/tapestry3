<title>Tapestry: Web Application Framework</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Components for implementing basic HTML Forms.  Most
components are straight forward 1:1 mappings between Tapestry components and a
corresponding HTML element. {@link com.primix.tapestry.form.PropertySelection} is more complicated,
as it manages way more of the process of implementing a &lt;select&gt; and its &lt;option&gt;s.

<p>Package {@link com.primix.tapestry.valid} contains more complex components that not only collect
input, but validate it as well.
