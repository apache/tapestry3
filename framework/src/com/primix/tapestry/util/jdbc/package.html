<p>A set of classes that assist with dynamically generating JDBC SQL queries.  Importantly,
they help hide the difference between a {@link java.sql.Statement} and
{@link java.sql.PreparedStatement} ... in fact, using a
{@link com.primix.tapestry.util.jdbc.StatementAssembly} you don't know in advance which
you'll get, which is very handy when generating truly dynamic SQL.
