/**
 *  Parses a Tapestry Script, an XML file defined by one of the following
 *  public identifiers:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><code>-//Primix Solutions//Tapestry Script 1.0//EN</code></li> 
 *  <li><code>-//Howard Ship//Tapestry Script 1.1//EN</code></li>
 *  <li><code>-//Howard Lewis Ship//Tapestry Script 1.2//EN</code></li>
 * .
 *
 *  <p>The version 1.1, is largely backwards compatible to the
 *  old script, but adds a number of new features (if, if-not, foreach
 *  and the use of property paths with insert).
 * 
 *  <p>Version 1.2 removes the &lt;insert&gt; element, using an Ant-like
 *  syntax (<code>${<i>expression</i>}</code>).  It also replaces
 *  the attribute name <code>property-path</code> with <code>expression</code>
 *  (because OGNL is used).
 *
 *  <p>A Tapestry Script is used, in association with the 
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.html.Body} and/or 
 *  {@link org.apache.tapestry.html.Script} components,
 *  to generate JavaScript for use with a Tapestry component.  Two seperate pieces
 *  of JavaScript can be generated.  The body section (associated with the <code>body</code>
 *  element of the XML document) is typically used to define JavaScript functions
 *  (most often, event handlers).  The initialization section
 *  (associated with the <code>initialization</code> element of the XML document)
 *  is used to add JavaScript that will be evaluated when the page finishes loading
 *  (i.e., from the HTML &lt;body&gt; element's onLoad event handler).
