/**
 *
 *  A type of static {@link org.apache.tapestry.IBinding} that gets it value from a public field
 *  (static class variable) of some class or interface.
 *
 *  <p>The binding uses a field name, which consists of a fully qualified class name and
 *  a static field of that class seperated by a dot.  For example: <code>com.foobar.SomeClass.SOME_FIELD</code>.
 *
 *  <p>If the class specified is for the <code>java.lang</code> package, then the package may be
 *  ommitted.  This allows <code>Boolean.TRUE</code> to be recognized as a valid value.
 *
 *  <p>The {@link org.apache.tapestry.IPageSource} maintains a cache of FieldBindings.  This means that
 *  each field will be represented by a single binding ... that means that for any field,
 *  the <code>accessValue()</code> method (which obtains the value for the field using
 *  reflection) will only be invoked once.
 *
 * @author Howard Lewis Ship

 * @deprecated To be removed in 2.5 with no replacement.  Can be accomplished using OGNL expressions.
