This is a test to ensure that comments are actually removed from the Tapestry template.

<!-- This is a comment that is removed.

It spans multiple lines.

-->

Just to be save, we'll do some nesting and such.

<jwc id="e"><!-- loop through the available whatevers -->
	<jwc id="insertName"/> <!-- another comment -->
</jwc><!-- e -->
