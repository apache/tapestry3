<ul>
<li>
Reorganized the packaging into a binary distribution (which includes documentation) and a second,
smaller, source-only distribution.</li>
<li>Renamed the JARs, stripping off the "net.sf." prefix.</li>
<li>Updated all examples to use the 1.4 Specification DTD.</li>
<li>Refactored (severely) the relationship between services and link components, splitting
 the rendering portion of links into a separate interface.</li>
</ul>
		
<pre>
[ 665622 ] net.sf.tapestry.html.Frame uses old DOCTYPE
[ 675882 ] option component generates invalid HTML

<h3>Release 2.4-alpha-2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made improvements to how Tapestry handles arrays of objects and scalars</li>
<LI>Upgrade demos to deploy into JBoss 3.0.4</LI>   
<li>Merge in changes from Tapestry 2.3</li>

</ul>

<pre>
[ 594878 ] Deploy Tapestry into JBoss 3.0.4
[ 672743 ] Pages Implementing Listeners cause NPE
</pre>

<h3>Release 2.4-alpha-1</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Added support for specifying expressions in the component template.  Expressions
are specified as attributes with the format "<code>[[ <i>expression</i> ]]</code>".
The brackets and leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
Expressions specified this way are the equivalent of the
<code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> 
        element in a specification. 
        

<li>
Tapestry now supports <i>implicit components</i>.  Implicit components are
declared exclusively in the containing component's template (instead of in
the containing component's specification) using a special
<code>jwcid</code> syntax:
<code>@<i>type</i></code> (for anonymous components) or
<code><i>id</i>@<i>type</i></code> (for named components). Implicit 
        components are especially useful for components that take no parameters, 
        but may also make use of template expressions. 
        

<li>
Added support for the
<code>&lt;listener-binding&gt;</code> element in page and component
specifications.  This allows a listener method to be provided, directly within the
specification, as a script written in a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf">BSF</a>-supported language. 
        

<li>
A number of non-backwards compatible changes were made to several
framework interfaces to support more flexibility on where specifications
and templates may be located, but these should not affect the overwhelming
majority of Tapestry users.  In addition, private assets and context assets
may also be relative.  

<br>
Private assets are relative to the component 
        specification which declares them, context assets are relative to the 
        application servlet (within the servlet context). 
        

<li>
Moved the Inspector out of the framework and 
        into the contrib library. 
        

<li>
Created smarter checks for stale sessions for 
        ActionLink, DirectLink and Form. The action and direct services used by 
        the components now encode whether the application was stateful into the 
        URL. The stateful check only occurs if the application was stateful when 
        the URL was rendered. 
        

<li>
Changed Form to record the exact ids generated during the render (it used to just store the count).
This allows a more useful exception message to be generated 
for the
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/StaleLinkException.html">StaleLinkException</a>. 

        

<li>
Changed the default StaleLink page to have a 
        message property, and to display the message from the 
        StaleLinkException. 
        

<li>
Components (and even pages) can now implement page listener interfaces
(<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageDetachListener.html">PageDetachListener</a>,
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageRenderListener.html">PageRenderListener</a> or
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageCleanupListener.html">PageCleanupListener</a>)
and <code>finishLoad()</code> will <i>automatically</i> add them as a listener to the 
        corresponding page events. 
        

<li>
The entire mechanism used to store persistant 
        page properties has been revised. 
        

<li>
Implemented a number of improvements to
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/util/pool/Pool.html">Pool</a>
to support greater flexibility in managing objects stored into and discarded
from the pool.
</li>

</ul>

Use the <code>Enum</code> implementation from Jakarta's
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang.html">commons-lang</a> library.

<p>
Rework dynamic code loading so that a subclass of
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/ApplicationServlet.html">ApplicationServlet</a>
is no longer necessary.

<p>Add methods to
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/INamespace.html">INamespace</a> and

is submitted, then an alert is displayed and the field is selected.

<p>Begin making more use of OGNL expressions in place of Java code.

<p>Malcom Edgar has contributed a <A href="doc/ComponentReference/DatePicker.html">DatePicker</a>
component.

<p>Some more refactorings: IComponent methods  addWrapped()/renderWrapped() -&gt; addBody()/renderBody().

<p>Tapestry documentation is now available in PDF format.

</pre>

<h3>Release 2.2-beta-1</h3>

<p>Tapestry has now replaced its simple
property path support with the far 
more powerful <a href="http://www.ognl.org">Object Graph
Navigation Library</a> expressions.  This promises to greatly extend
the expressiveness of the specifications and further reduce
the need for Java code.  The <code>property-path</code>
attribute of the <code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> element has been renamed
to <code>expression</code> (this only affects the latest, 1.3, version
of the DTD).

<p>There are some small costs to using OGNL; the largest being
a restriction in bean names, component ids and asset names.  All
of these must now be valid Java identifiers, and so cannot contain the 
dash ('-') character, which was previously permitted.  This affects all
specifications, including older versions.

<p>Malcolm Edgar has lead the push to provide an excellent
<A href="doc/ComponentReference">Tapestry Component Reference</a>.

<p>
You can now control the exact location of a component template by 
declaring an asset named <code>$template</code> (which is not normally
a legal asset name, due to the dollar sign).  If such an asset exists,
then it is used as the template.

<p>A number of poorly named components have been renamed:
<ul>
<li>Action -&gt; ActionLink
<li>Direct -&gt; DirectLink
<li>InsertBlock -&gt; RenderBlock
<li>InsertWrapped -&gt; RenderBody
<li>Page -&gt; PageLink
<li>Service -&gt; ServiceLink
<li>ShowInspector -&gt; InspectorButton
<li>Text -&gt; TextArea< /li> 
</ul>

<p>Previous names will be maintained until at least release 2.3.

<p>
In addition, the documentation has been brought (largely) up to date
with the significant changes so far in release 2.2.

<pre>
[ 582421 ] Way to specify template location
[ 596929 ] NumericField params require java-type
[ 597314 ] Problems with URLs
[ 595985 ] Tapestry behind firewall
[ 598609 ] NumericField displayWidth inconsistent
[ 598371 ] Radio and RadioGroup broken
[ 599608 ] App startup exception
[ 599663 ] Disallow spec path a comp. type
[ 601018 ] Use OGNL instead of home brew
</pre>


<h3>Release 2.2-alpha-4</h3>

Update to latest versions of JCommon, JFreeChart and Log4J.  Added the
&lt;extension&gt; element to the application and library specifications.

<pre>
[ 584040 ] Add hooks for custom configuration
[ 579081 ] getApplicationSpecification
[ 587683 ] Frameset tag for JavaScript
[ 589818 ] Forward, not redirect, to local resource
[ 591352 ] &lt;bean&gt; should allow &lt;property&gt;
[ 592289 ] helper bean: render lifecycle
[ 591801 ] Exception changing log priority
</pre>

<h3>Release 2.2-alpha-3</h3>

Tapestry now supports libraries, which can provide components, pages and engine services to
an application.  Libraries can also include libraries.  The application specification
has been ammended to include a new &lt;library&gt; element, and a new type of specification,
the library specification, has been added.

<p>
Renamed all page specifications from ".jwc" to ".page".

<pre>
[ 584466 ] Cant set bean prop from localized string
[ 494453 ] invalid-date-format message string wrong
[ 584731 ] Text's value parameter required
[ 579843 ] PageLoader INFO msg wrong
[ 586171 ] Add namespace/library support
</pre>

<h3>Release 2.2-alpha-2</h3>

Revamp how services construct and parse URLs.  Rework service parameters to
be typed objects, instead of simple strings (this is a change which
may break some existing code).

<p>
A new version of the DTD may now be used which distinguishes between
page specifications and component specifications (page specifications
do not specify several attributes and elements related to 
component parameters).

<pre>
[ 581199 ] Slashes in service parameters
[ 581160 ] Wrong case in WAR file name
[ 579583 ] Simplify PropertySelection
