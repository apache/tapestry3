<h3>Release 2.4-???-?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allow &lt;set-property&gt; element of specification to specify the expression as an attribute or
as wrapped character data.</li>
<li>The interfaces for <a href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/IValidationDelegate.html">IValidationDelegate</a>,
 <a href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/IValidator.html">IValidator</a> and
  <a href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/ValidatorException.html">ValidatorException</a>
changed incompatibly.  This will only be an issue if you have created custom validation delegates or custom
validators.</li>
<li>Added methods to <a href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/valid/IComponentStrings.html">IComponentStrings</a> for formatting localized strings
with arguments.</li>
</ul>		
	
<h3>Release 2.4-alpha-3</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Reorganized the packaging into a binary distribution (which includes documentation) and a second,
smaller, source-only distribution.</li>
<li>Renamed the JARs, stripping off the "net.sf." prefix.</li>
<li>Updated all examples to use the 1.4 Specification DTD.</li>
<li>Refactored (severely) the relationship between services and link components, splitting
 the rendering portion of links into a separate interface.</li>
<li>Upgrade to McKoi database 0.94h.</li>
<li>Tapestry will now create properties for connected parameters, if the properties
 do not already exist (or are abstract).</li>
<li>Renamed the <code>java-type</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;parameter&gt;</code> element (in component
 specifications) to <code>type</code> (for the 1.4 DTD).</li>
<li>Allowed more elements to specify values as character data inside the element as an alternative
to using a particular attribute (useful for complex OGNL expressions).
<li>Continued extending the JUnit test suite.
<li>Deprecated the <code>PageCleanupListener</code> interface and removed support for it.
</ul>

<h3>Release 2.4-alpha-2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made improvements to how Tapestry handles arrays of objects and scalars</li>
<LI>Upgrade demos to deploy into JBoss 3.0.4</LI>   
<li>Merge in changes from Tapestry 2.3</li>
<li><code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> elements may now specify the expression as the parsed data
instead of the expression attribute</li> 
<li>The template extension may now be overriden using the configuration property <code>net.sf.tapestry.template-extension</code>         
<li>Added support for declarative transient and persistent properties via
<code>&lt;property-specification&gt;</code> element in page and component specifications.  Tapestry
will create (on the fly) a subclass with
the necessary accessor methods and fields, as well as any necessary notification and
cleanup methods. </li>

<h3>Release 2.4-alpha-1</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Added support for specifying expressions in the component template.  Expressions
are specified as attributes with the format "<code>[[ <i>expression</i> ]]</code>".
The brackets and leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
Expressions specified this way are the equivalent of the
<code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> 
        element in a specification. 
        

<li>
Tapestry now supports <i>implicit components</i>.  Implicit components are
declared exclusively in the containing component's template (instead of in
the containing component's specification) using a special
<code>jwcid</code> syntax:
<code>@<i>type</i></code> (for anonymous components) or
<code><i>id</i>@<i>type</i></code> (for named components). Implicit 
        components are especially useful for components that take no parameters, 
        but may also make use of template expressions. 
        

<li>
Added support for the
<code>&lt;listener-binding&gt;</code> element in page and component
specifications.  This allows a listener method to be provided, directly within the
specification, as a script written in a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf">BSF</a>-supported language. 
        

<li>
A number of non-backwards compatible changes were made to several
framework interfaces to support more flexibility on where specifications
and templates may be located, but these should not affect the overwhelming
majority of Tapestry users.  In addition, private assets and context assets
may also be relative.  

<br>
Private assets are relative to the component 
        specification which declares them, context assets are relative to the 
        application servlet (within the servlet context). 
        

<li>
Moved the Inspector out of the framework and 
        into the contrib library. 
        

<li>
Created smarter checks for stale sessions for 
        ActionLink, DirectLink and Form. The action and direct services used by 
        the components now encode whether the application was stateful into the 
        URL. The stateful check only occurs if the application was stateful when 
        the URL was rendered. 
        

<li>
Changed Form to record the exact ids generated during the render (it used to just store the count).
This allows a more useful exception message to be generated 
for the
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/StaleLinkException.html">StaleLinkException</a>. 

        

<li>
Changed the default StaleLink page to have a 
        message property, and to display the message from the 
        StaleLinkException. 
        

<li>
Components (and even pages) can now implement page listener interfaces
(<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageDetachListener.html">PageDetachListener</a>,
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageRenderListener.html">PageRenderListener</a> or
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/event/PageCleanupListener.html">PageCleanupListener</a>)
and <code>finishLoad()</code> will <i>automatically</i> add them as a listener to the 
        corresponding page events. 
        

<li>
The entire mechanism used to store persistant 
        page properties has been revised. 
        

<li>
Implemented a number of improvements to
<A href="doc/api/net/sf/tapestry/util/pool/Pool.html">Pool</a>
to support greater flexibility in managing objects stored into and discarded
from the pool.
</li>

</ul>

[ 653358 ] IPage.getName() == qualified name
[ 608768 ] Changes saved AFTER IPage.detach()
