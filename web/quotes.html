”Tapestry met all of our requirements and helped us proceed onto a
 successful release.”
</div>
We used Tapestry to implement the monitoring and administration console
for
a wireless network management product.  Initially, we implemented a
demonstration using standard JSP but we realized that JSPs presented
 difficulties for implementation.  Some of our requirements were a very
aggressive development schedule, integration with EJB 2.0 beans, ability
to
write modular reusable components, very reliable, easy code maintenance,
 internationalization, and of course easier debugging than the generated
JSP
code.  Tapestry met all of our requirements and helped us proceed onto a
 successful release.

<p>
After reading the tutorial and reviewing the examples, we started with
writing simple components.  We started with a StatusImage
component.  The
GIF for the status image should be localized and selected based on
standard
 network status states.  Another example of a simple component was a
validating IP address 
text field.  The IP address field uses the Tapestry
validation framework.  After that, we moved onto more complex components
like the StatusTable shown in the figure.  
This table has a varying number of rows depending on the configuration of the product using the Tapestry
Foreach component (very cool).  This StatusTable makes use of another
 essential Tapestry component, the Conditional.  Looking at the Actions
columns, the set of actions is conditional based on the row.  All this
logic
 happens in the Java class and is not embedded into our HTML making
maintenance much easier.

”Tapestry's flexibility along with its
clean object-oriented architecture
made our web interface shine.”
</div>
Finally, we integrated servlets and JSPs into our Tapestry web
application.
 We needed servlet integration for charting and JSPs for reporting.  With
all
 this flexibility, we could use each technology where they worked best.

Overall, all of Tapestry's flexibility along with its clean
object-oriented
 architecture made our web interface shine.

</div>
I've said it before and I'll say it again... 
You owe it to yourself to take a serious look at Tapestry. 
It's the most exciting model in Java web development 
I've seen in a long time. It really allows you to build applications--not web sites--that "execute on the web." Very cool stuff.

”Tapestry is the best solution to the presentation tier ...”
</div>
Tapestry is the best solution to the presentation tier and it provides a clean separation of content and developer code. 
First, I extended it for WAP support, then I developed several WAP components and 
finally I developed a complete email application for WAP in a record time.

”Tapestry is the best framework I have seen that offers this sort of separation.”
</div>
 When using Struts or Velocity, in order to see what the finished
page will look like, they must assemble the application, deploy it, and run it,
just to see what the finished product is going to look like. 
The graphic designers
basically lose all the luxuries of WYSIWYG development ...
I spent 30 minutes or so with one of our graphic designers here, 
and he was giddy at what I showed him as I redesigned one of our smaller 
apps using Tapestry. 

<p>
Bottom line for us is this: We have graphic designers and we have developers, 
and I don't want them to necessarily have to know each others' job to get things done.
Tapestry is the best framework I have seen that offers this sort of separation.

”We 
are able to publish any kind of our metadata-driven business objects with just 
a handful of generic, highly dynamic pages, using customizable components.”
</div>
As a 'lay developer' using Tapestry I can only recommend it. 
We have built a content management system
based on Tapestry, plus multiple sites that are now powered by it. 
Thanks to its component architecture, we 
are able to publish any kind of our metadata-driven business objects with just 
a handful of generic, highly dynamic pages, using customizable components. 
All business logic is encapsulated in business objects 
and services, so there is not really much logic in the presentation layer besides the navigation parts. 

<p>
The learning curve is not flat, but is really worth 
the effort. If you need to bring a dynamic web-app to the browser 
Tapestry offers many predefined and stable components to build on. 
We have gone with Tapestry and we will continue to use it
in the next couple of projects needing a web-interface, too.
