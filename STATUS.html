<h1>Votes - Release 3.0</h1>

<h2>Sep 5 2003 - release 3.0-beta-3</h2>

<blockquote>
People have been itching for the next release of Tapestry;
one where the demos work (woops!)
including JavaScript and the Palette. Documentation is still 
not ready for an rc release, but I
think a beta release is a good idea.

<h2>Sep 3 2003 - Erik Hatcher as committer (Goeff Longman)</h2>

<blockquote>
I nominate Erik Hatcher. He knows the score in jakarta-land. I think its a great idea.

<h2>Sep 3 2003 - Tsvetelin Saykov as committer (Mindbridge)

<blockquote>
I would like to nominate Tsvetelin Saykov as a committer. Tsvetelin has more than an year and a half of Tapestry experience, has worked with many large web projects, and can be very helpful overall for the development of the framework, especially in the area of dynamic pages with layout determined at runtime. (not to mention that he would need CVS access to work on the Tree)

</p>

<h2>Sep 2 2003 - Harish Krishnaswamy as committer (hlship)</h2>

<blockquote>
I would like to nominate Harish; he has been very actively and
enthusiastically supporting Tapestry
in the mailing lists. I think he would be an excellent and valuable  
asset to the team.  And hell,
he's relatively local --- I might actually get to meet a Tapestry  
committer in person!

<h2>Jul 13 2003 - Release 3.0-beta-2 (hlship)</h2>	

<blockquote>
We informally discussed this not too long ago; I think we are at a good point for beta-2.  There have been some significant improvements since beta-1a that will largely be invisible to most users (the correct thing for a beta release); at the same time, I think we're all anxious to push forward and get Tapestry 3.0-xxx into wider distribution.  Although there are still several outstanding bugs (one or two that are problematic) I think this is a good time to keep momentum going and release the next beta.

A +1 vote will procede with beta-2, tagging the repository and pushing the new releases out to the Apache distribution mirrors.

<h2>Apr 17 2003 - Tapestry NextGen released as 3.0 (hlship)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
The discussion on the version number for the next Tapestry release seems to have died down, and there seemed fairly strong support for "3.0".
</p>	

<p>
PROPOSAL: the next major release of Tapestry (previously known as 2.4 or
NextGen) be released as version number 3.0.
</p>

<p>
Please vote before the end of (your) Tuesday (15 April), otherwise will assume +0.</p>

<h2>Mar 7 2003 - Nominate David Solis as Tapestry Commiter (hlship)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There really didn't seem to be much discussion ... everyone seems to be in favor.  Mind Bridge seems very absent of late.</p>

<p>Let's put it to a vote.  No answer within 24 hours will be treated as a +0.</p>

<p>If voted in, David Solis will be invited to become a Tapestry committer; will be granted voting rights and update access to the CVS repository.	</p>
