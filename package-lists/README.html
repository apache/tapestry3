<h1>Readme</h1>

<p>
Each subdirectory contains the JavaDoc package list downloaded from the corresponding package's
web site.  When upgrading to a new version of a library, get the updated package list and store it
in the appropriate directory.  The <code>curl</code> command is handy for doing this.
