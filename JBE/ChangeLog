* Jun 14 2001 hship

Minor output changes during builds, including, display the
number of files to compile.

Add support for JAR/WAR Manifests.
Change/simplify how Java and resource cataloging takes place.

* May 2 2001 hship

Default directory for Java source is now 'src' instead of '.'.
Improve the code that rebuilds the JBE tools.
Strip '.exe' from tools names on Cygwin (not necessary, Cygwin finds the right file for us).

* Apr 26 2001 hship

Make the WebLogic module compress the deployable EJB Jar.

* Apr 24 2001 hship

Make use of standard Cygwin mounts (/usr/bin), rather than relying on setting of
TOOLS_DIR.

Minor improvements to the JBE Splice command.


* Apr 10 2001 hship

Add targets and rules in DocBook.mk to support packaging the HTML for distribution
to a web site.

No longer distribute OpenJade with the JBE.
Add support for SED and CHMOD to the Platform.*.mk files.
More tweaking on the DocBook module, including strip out RTF generation.

* Feb 9 2001 hship

Reinstate SGML validation of DocBook documents (before apply stylesheets), even though
onsgmls is broken (can't properly report errors) ... we at least get the line numbers.

* Feb 6 2001 hship

Rename a couple of variables (LOCAL_CLASSPATH to PROJ_CLASSPATH and MODULE_NAME
to PROJECT_NAME).
Start of DocBook module rule to validate the input with the onsgmls parser (which
alas, has bugs).

* Feb 2 2001 hship

Initial work on alternate targets for DocBook.  Added rtf.

* Jan 31 2001 hship

Fix DocBook.mk to change into the HTML directory when running openjade
(otherwise, intra-document links are broken).

Remove some older SITE_xxx variables, no longer used.
Use the -c option with openjade, instead of setting SGML_CATALOG_FILES variable.

Add Solaris support.  Add sample LocalConfig.mk and SiteConfig.mk.
Rename JDK.Sun_Win32.mk to JDK.Sun_Cygwin.mk.

* Jan 10 2001 hship

Update copyrights.

* Jan 10 2001 hship

Slight touch up, adding tool option variables which will make porting to
non-GNU environments (like Solaris) a bit easier.

* Dec 28 2000 hship

Include the config directory in the distribution, with a README.

* Dec 26 2000 hship

Change definition of JAVADOC_DIR to be the actual directory (i.e., no longer tack
on MODULE_NAME).

* Dec 22 2000 hship

Reorganize the JBE Utils, add the new splice command (used to automatically
edit configuration files).

properly with GNU Make 3.79.

More cleanups and improvements; support some additional user-define pre- and post-
targets.
Simplify the rules for compiling the JBE utility; extend it to support compiling
any additional Java files in the directory.

* Dec 11 2000 hship

Make use of the Make $(call) function to simplify/improve the makefiles.

* Nov 20 2000 hship

More changes to the JBE to support Solaris.  Solaris doesn't always use GNU tools, so we
need to use the short versions of many command line parameters.

* Nov 20 2000 hship

Release 0.2.6

* Nov 16 2000 hship

Don't use -n option with echo, since it isn't supported under Solaris.

change in WebLogic 6.0.
[114707] Seperate Platform from JDK

* Sep 28 2000 hship

Improve handling of dependencies of jar files:  make the WebLogic deplyable jar
dependent on the any framework jars; make installed jars dependent on Module jars (rather
than blindly copying them).

* Sep 25 2000 hship

Speed up writing of catalog entries by using $(addprefix) to generate a single long line
(the old way invoked echo.exe a zillion times).

* Sep 24 2000 hship

Attempt to speed up the build a little, by including the relative
pathname to source and resource files in the catalogs.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Hide a make invocation (related to generating the catalog) with a '@'.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Split part of ModuleRules.mk into CommonRules.mk and some other re-organizing.
