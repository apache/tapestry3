[114707] Seperate Platform from JDK

* Sep 28 2000 hship

Improve handling of dependencies of jar files:  make the WebLogic deplyable jar
dependent on the any framework jars; make installed jars dependent on Module jars (rather
than blindly copying them).

Speed up writing of catalog entries by using $(addprefix) to generate a single long line

Attempt to speed up the build a little, by including the relative
pathname to source and resource files in the catalogs.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Hide a make invocation (related to generating the catalog) with a '@'.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Split part of ModuleRules.mk into CommonRules.mk and some other re-organizing.
