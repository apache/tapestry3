non-GNU environments (like Solaris) a bit easier.

* Dec 28 2000 hship

Include the config directory in the distribution, with a README.

* Dec 26 2000 hship

Change definition of JAVADOC_DIR to be the actual directory (i.e., no longer tack
on MODULE_NAME).

Reorganize the JBE Utils, add the new splice command (used to automatically
edit configuration files).

* Dec 22 2000 hship

Reorganize to support multiple JDK releases and vendors.

Always remove package.html from the list of package resources.

More tweaking to get things just right.

* Dec 15 2000 hship

Lots of cleanups and improvements.  Simplified, reorganized and made things work
properly with GNU Make 3.79.

* Dec 11 2000 hship

More cleanups and improvements; support some additional user-define pre- and post-
targets.
Simplify the rules for compiling the JBE utility; extend it to support compiling
any additional Java files in the directory.

* Dec 11 2000 hship

Make use of the Make $(call) function to simplify/improve the makefiles.

* Nov 20 2000 hship

More changes to the JBE to support Solaris.  Solaris doesn't always use GNU tools, so we

Release 0.2.6

* Nov 16 2000 hship

Don't use -n option with echo, since it isn't supported under Solaris.

Begin adding support for jBoss.

Add some comments to WebLogic.mk to make clear it is for WebLogic 5.1 and things will
change in WebLogic 6.0.
[114707] Seperate Platform from JDK

* Sep 28 2000 hship

Improve handling of dependencies of jar files:  make the WebLogic deplyable jar
dependent on the any framework jars; make installed jars dependent on Module jars (rather
than blindly copying them).

* Sep 25 2000 hship

Speed up writing of catalog entries by using $(addprefix) to generate a single long line
(the old way invoked echo.exe a zillion times).

* Sep 24 2000 hship

Attempt to speed up the build a little, by including the relative
pathname to source and resource files in the catalogs.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Hide a make invocation (related to generating the catalog) with a '@'.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Split part of ModuleRules.mk into CommonRules.mk and some other re-organizing.

* Sep 19 2000 hship

Support modules with no packages, plus other minor tweaks.

* Sep 18 2000 hship

Started ChangeLog (some time after release 0.1.1).
[114704] Should allow source tree to live in different directory
[114708] JBE should remove duplicates from the classpath
