This directory contains modified versions of the following distributions:

Distribution                             Source
=============================            =================================
OpenJade 1.3					         http://www.sscd.de/openjade/
DocBook SGML DTD 4.1                     http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/4.1/index.html
DocBook Modular DSSSL style sheets 1.62  http://www.nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/

The original distributions have been stripped down and re-archived using GNU tar.  OpenJade
is a project on SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openjade/

The missing ISO 8879:1986 entity sets have been obtained from http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/ISOEnts.zip,
renamed slightly, and included with the DocBook DTD.

The DocBook catalog has been modified to comment out the DTDDECL declarations that are not recognized by 
OpenJade.
