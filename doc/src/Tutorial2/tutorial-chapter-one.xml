  <para>
    Tapestry is an application framework for developing web applications.  It uses
    a component object model to represent the pages of a web application.  This is 
    similar to spirit to using the Java Swing component object model to build GUIs.
  </para>
  <para>
    This tutorial exists to help newcomers quickly understand Tapestry. 
    <xref linkend="intro"/> 
    begins by providing some detail on various ways in which you can use Tapestry in your environment.
    <xref linkend="getting-started"/> and <xref linkend="Introductory-examples"/> provide both a basic
    understanding of Tapestry, along with some introductory examples.

    <xref linkend="pages"/>, 
    <xref linkend="forms"/>, 
    <xref linkend="built-ins"/>,
    <xref linkend="assets"/> and
    <xref linkend="localization"/> 
    explain the core Tapestry concepts in detail, providing full 
    examples along the way to assist you in learning how the framework is used.

    The remainder of the tutorial provides useful information on advanced topics including component creation,
    usage of the component inspector, EJB support, and optimizations.

    <title>Working with Tapestry</title>
    <para>
      The goal of Tapestry is to eliminate most of the coding in a web application.  Under Tapestry, 
      nearly all code is directly related to application functionality, with very little "plumbing".  If you 
      have previously developed a web application using Microsoft Active Server Pages, JavaServer 
      Pages or Java Servlets, you may take for granted all the plumbing:  writing servlets, assembling 
      URLs, parsing URLs, managing objects inside the &HttpSession;, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      Tapestry takes care of nearly all of that, for free.  It allows for the development of rich, highly 
      interactive applications.
    </para>
    <para>
      Before you get into the wonders of Tapestry, you will need to setup your development
      environment such that you are able to both run the provided tutorial applications, 
      and also such that you are able to 
      compile and run the code that you develop while moving through this tutorial.

    <para>
      This document expects that you will have extracted the full Tapestry distribution to your 
      <filename class="directory">C:</filename> drive
      <footnote>
        <para>
	  If you are using Solaris or another non-Windows operating system, you're expected
	  to be savvy enough to translate to a sensibly constructed file system.
	</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>
    <para>
      This will have created a directory <filename class="directory">C:\Tapestry-<replaceable>x.x</replaceable>
      </filename>
      and, beneath it, several more directories.
      <footnote>
        <para>
	  The three numbers are the release number.  At the time of this writing, the release
	  was 2.2, but this is constantly changing.  Simply adjust the actual pathname to
	  reflect the release of Tapestry you downloaded.
	</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>
    <para>
      The source code for the Tutorial is distributed as a JAR file,
      <filename>src/examples-src.jar</filename>.  A precompiled WAR file,
      <filename>lib/tutorial.war</filename> is included in the distribution.
    </para>
    
    
    <para>
      The Tapestry distribution includes an &Ant; build file that allows the
      Tutorial to be directly executed.  Ant release 1.5 is required.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      From the Tapestry root directory,
      execute the command <command>ant -emacs run-tutorial</command>, which will launch the
      Jetty server for the Tutorial.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once Jetty is running, you can access the Tutorials using the URL 
      <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/tutorial">
	<filename>http://localhost:8080/tutorial</filename>
      </ulink>.

    Tapestry can exist in any Servlet (v2.1 +) compatible container,
    for example JBoss. If you wish to deploy and run the tutorial in 
    an alternative environment please see <xref linkend="integration"/>

    <title>A basic development environment</title>
    <para>
      This section details how to setup a development environment suitable
      for use with this tutorial. It will provide basic &Ant; support, and
      the ability to test your examples using &Jetty;.
