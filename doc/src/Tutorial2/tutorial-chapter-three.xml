  	This section provides a set of examples that show some of the fundamental aspects of
  	Tapestry. It begins with a discussion on Tapestry binding, which is the process by which you 
  	as a developer link your objects to the components in the HTML page. Moving on, we 
  	create a simple multiple page application using the &Page; component, and then show
  	how to respond to user actions (typically Submit buttons) via the &Action; component.

  		<title>Introduction to Tapestry Binding</title>
  		<para>
  		Most components have more than a single property. For example, the &Form; component typically
  		requires that both <varname>listener</varname> and <varname>delegate</varname> properties be set to
  		something meaningful.
  		</para>
  		<para>
  		There are multiple ways to provide values for the component properties:
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Property Binding</term>
					<listitem><para>
					Binds a component value to something, using an &OGNL; (Object Graph Navigation Language) expression. 
					This is the most flexible
					binding type within Tapestry. These bindings in the most part look like JavaBean property names
					strung together with dots. e.g: <varname>visit.name</varname>, would work against against
					the following object graph:	<function>this.getVisit().getName()</function>.  
					Virtually anything can be references by 
					an &OGNL; expression, including methods, JavaBean properties and static fields 
					(<function>Boolean.TRUE</function>).</para>
					<para>
					<emphasis>All OGNL expressions are evaluated in the context of a current object, and a chain 
					simply uses the result of the previous link in the chain as the current object for the next one. 
					You can extend a chain as long as you like. (from &OGNL; web site)</emphasis>
					In Tapestry, the current object that you start with is the object for the page 
					in question. For the 'hello world' application covered previously, this is the
					OGNL expressions must begin their evaluation somewhere. In Tapestry, this is  
					the <classname>tutorial.hello.Home</classname> obect.
					Lets run through a few quick examples:
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>sometext</emphasis> to access <function>public String getSomeText()</function> from the example</listitem>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>sometext.length()</emphasis> to access the <function>length()</function> method of the <function>String</function> object returned by the <function>getSomeText()</function> methodd.</listitem>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>true</emphasis> to refer to the constant which equals 'true' or <function>Boolean.TRUE</function></listitem>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>user.listAllCustomers()</emphasis> to get the <function>Collection</function> from the method <functon>currentPageObject.getUser().listAllCustomers()</functon> which is a member of the current page object</listitem>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>@com.someplace.MyClass@interestingMethod("hello world")</emphasis> to return the value from the static method <function>com.someplace.MyClass.interestingMethod(String arg)</function></listitem>
						<listitem>Use <emphasis>@Boolean@TRUE</emphasis> to refer to <function>Boolean.TRUE</function>
					</orderedlist>
					</para>

					This section provides only a brief introdcution to the use of OGNL. For a full explanation, see the &OGNL; website.

					<listitem><para>A completely static piece of text, hardcoded into the component specification.</para></listitem>

				<varlistentry>
					<term>Field Binding</term>
					<listitem><para>
					Refers to a static member variable on some class, e.g: <function>Boolean.TRUE</function>
					or <function>com.mycompany.myclass.MyObject.SOMEVAR</function>. Static bindings must use full qualified
					object names, except if the property being referenced is part of <function>java.lang</function>
					</para>
					</listitem>

				<varlistentry>
					<term>String Binding</term>
					<listitem><para>
					Used for localization, the value of this binding should refer to some localized asset.
