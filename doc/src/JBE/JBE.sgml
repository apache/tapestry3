	<chapter id="introduction">
		<title>Introduction</title>
		 
<para>As envisioned but most tool makers, the life of a Java developer is a solitary one.  
Parked at his or her desk, with only his trusty tools, IDEs and the command line, 
the developer creates the wonderful applets, applications and frameworks possible using Java.</>
		
<para>The developer has and requires great freedom; each tool in his or her arsenal may have come from
a different company; each tool may have been installed into a directory of his or her liking.  
This is not a problem because the developer is only accountable to him- or her-self, and these 
selections of tools and locations will only aftect one person.</>

<para>Alas, in the real world, developers work on teams and share code using source code repositories. 
They may be physically located across the hallway, or across the planet.  
As they work, they may make conflicting changes to code.</>

<para>What's needed is a system that can adjust for local differences in developer's
environments and allow for "clean builds" of modules directly from source. 
That's what the Java Build Environment (JBE) is for.</>

<para>JBE is designed to start with basic Java source and utlimately produce a Java Archive (JAR) 
or Web Archive (WAR) ready for testing or deployment.  
This may involve many steps, including compiling Java code, 
creating RMI stubs and skeletons,  using application-server specific tools 
(such as WebLogic ejbc), combining the results into a JAR file ... even creating Javadoc.</>

<para>
Without JBE, there are three options for doing all this:
			<itemizedlist>

				<listitem>
<para>The command line.  Developers may simply execute the <command>java</> and 
<command>jar</> commands themselves.
This leads to problems when steps are missed, or the commands are in some way dependent
on a single developer's environment (for example, the setting of the <envar>CLASSPATH</> variable).</>
				</listitem>
			
				<listitem>
<para>Batch commands / shell scripts.  Hard to develop and debug and non-portable between platforms.
Often assembled in a hurry that leads to the same kind of environment problems as using 
the command line.</>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
<para>IDE.  Some IDEs can assemble JARs, or even interface to an application server
to build and deploy EJBs and WARs; however, this will require that the user interactively
use the IDE's tools.  Also, these tools are idiosyncratic; getting them to package up the correct Java classes 
and resources is often challenging.</>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>JBE includes many hooks to allow custom directories, compiliation options
or other configuration (such as JDK release and vendor) to be specified.  Other hooks allow for additional processing, 
such as signing a JAR.</>


<para>JBE is designed to be portable, meaning the same source files and Makefiles will work across
multiple developer's workstations ... even when using different operating systems
(such as Windows, Linux and Solaris).</>

<para>
Because the JBE is based on GNU Make it is extermely adaptable and extensible.
JBE Makefiles can do more than simply compile Java files, they can also run tests, 
launch applications, prepare distributions virtually any operation that can be
done using shell scripts or command macros, though Makefile syntax is cleaner, easier
and platform independent.</>

<para>
JBE is most useful with medium to large scale Java projects.
It has no support for compiling anything but Java; projects which 
use native code are beyond its scope.</>

	</chapter>


	<chapter id="installation">
		<title>Installation and Configuration</title>

<para>JBE is distributed as a part of the Tapestry distribution, in the JBE directory.</>

<para>Under Windows, it is necessary to perform a separate installation to
provide the necessary GNU tools, including GNU Make. 
JBE was developed under Windows (Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and Windows 2000 Professional), 
and makes use of the Cygwin tools library.</>

<para>The JBE is also operational under Solaris, and future plans are ports
to various Linux distributions.</>

<para>Because my direct experience is to suffer the indignities of Windows development,
the examples in this document use Windows pathnames.  
Developers using Linux or Solaris should be able to translate to their sensibly 
named file systems.</>

<para>On any operating system it is necessary to have a JDK installed.
JBE was developed using Sun's JDK 1.2.2 and JDK 1.3.
The JDK used by the JBE is configurable (details are below).</>

		<section id="solaris">
			<title>Installing under Solaris</title>

<para>The JBE has been ported to work with Solaris 2.6 or above.  
This version of Solaris does not, by default, include the GNU tools.  
The JBE requires the presense of GNU tar and GNU zip, which are a separate install. 
GNU tar should be installed as /usr/local/bin/gtar.</>
		</section>

		<section id="windows">
			<title>Installing under Windows</title>

<para>Cygwin is a set of GNU tools ported so as to run in the Windows NT or Windows 2000 
environments (it may also work under Windows 95/98/ME).</>

<para>Cygwin is available at http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.</>

<para>Installing Cygwin is very easy; Cygwin starts by downloading a small installer 
called setup.exe.  Running this program allows the user to install any of the many
individual packages in Cygwin individually.  
You should download this program from the Cygnus web site to a safe 
directory (you use the same program later to update your installation
with newer versions of the packages).

			<title>Environment Variables</title>

<para>The JBE is packaged with Tapestry; if you are reading this document, 
then you have probably already unpacked the Tapestry distribtution.  
The JBE is stored in the JBE subdirectory of the distribution.</>

<para>It is necessary to create an environment variable, 
<envar>SYS_MAKEFILE_DIR</>,
that points to the directory.   
Use forward slashes as the path seperator, even under Windows.  A typical 
value for this is <filename class=directory>C:/Tapestry-x.x.x/JBE</> 
(depending on which release of Tapestry you downloaded, and where you installed it).</>

		</section>

		<section id="conf">
			<title>Configuration</title>

<para>Configuration is accomplished by creating additional files used by GNU Make at runtime.</>

<para>Under the JBE directory will be a <filename class=directory>config</> directory.  
Create a new file, <filename>SiteConfig.mk</filename>, in the directory.  
This file is used to specify the platform for the local workstation.
</>

<example>
	<title>config/SiteConfig.mk</title>
	<programlisting># Defines the local platform.

SITE_PLATFORM := Cygwin</programlisting>
</example>

<note>
	<para>
	An example file, <filename>SiteConfig.example.mk</filename> is provided in the
	<filename class=directory>config</> directory, you can simply copy or rename it
	to <filename>SiteConfig.mk</>.
	</>
</>

<para>Platforms correspond to the <filename>Platform.<replaceable>name</>.mk</>
file in the main JBE directory.</para>

<para>This file may also be used to store addtional, site-wide options 
(typically, variables that start with the prefix 
<varname>SITE_</>).  Such options will apply to all modules built on the local workstation.</>

<para>In a multiple-developer environment, all developers on the
same platform will use identical copies of the <filename>SiteConfig.mk</> file.

<note>
	<para>
		Because of the way GNU Make works, all of these declarations could be made by
		creating additional environment variables.  However, it is far easier to edit
		these makefiles than it is to deal with editting environment variables.  Instead,
		the JBE requires only a single environment variable,
		<envar>SYS_MAKEFILE_DIR</>, to be set.
	</>
</>

<para>A second configuration file, <filename>config/LocalConfig.mk</filename>, 
is used to establish the directories into which related tools have been installed.  For example:
</>

<example>
	<title>config/LocalConfig.mk</title>
	<programlisting>TOOLS_DIR := C:/cygwin/bin

JDK_Sun_1.2.2_DIR := C:/jdk1.2.2
JDK_Sun_1.3_DIR := C:/jdk1.3

WEBLOGIC_DIR := C:/WebLogic</>
</example>

<note>
	<para>
	An example file, <filename>LocalConfig.example.mk</filename> is provided in the
	<filename class=directory>config</> directory, you can simply copy or rename it
	to <filename>SiteConfig.mk</>.  It sets <varname>TOOLS_DIR</varname> and the
	two JDK directories (as shown above), but not <varname>WEBLOGIC_DIR</>.
	</>
</>

<para>The first variable, <varname>TOOLS_DIR</>, is the directory for the GNU tools.   
Since this example is for Windows 2000 using Cygwin, the tools directory is the Cygwin bin directory.</>

<para>The next two variables define the locations of two JDKs installed on the local workstation.  
The JBE considers a JDK to be a combination of a vendor and a release. 
You must create a variable <filename>JDK_<replaceable>vendor</>_<replaceable>release</>_DIR</>
for each combination.

<para>Unless overriden in some way, the default JDK is Sun 1.3.</>

<para><filename>LocalConfig.mk</>
is also a useful place to specify other global variables.  
In the example, the variable <varname>WEBLOGIC_DIR</> is specified,
to identify where the WebLogic application server was installed ... 
this is only needed you will be creating EJB deployments for Weblogic.</>

	<chapter id="usingJBE">
		<title>Using the JBE</title>

<para>The JBE performs builds on projects.  
For the JBE, a project is a directory which contains a number of Java packages.  
The source code in all the packages will be compiled and eventually combined into a single JAR file.</>

<para>The JBE requires a project makefile in the project directory, 
whose job is to set global options for the entire project, and to identify the list of Java packages.
Each package <emphasis >may</> also have its own <filename>Makefile</>,
which is used to identify the Java source files, resource files and RMI classes for that package.</>

<para>
The project makefile also identifies the type of JBE <emphasis>module</> the project uses.  The module
determines whether a Jar, a War or something else is produced by the project.
</>

<para>The standard directory hierarchy for a package has the module directory 
as the root of the Java package tree for the package:</>
 
<figure>
	<title>Example Project Layout</>

	<mediaobject>
		<imageobject>
			<imagedata fileref="images/proj-layout.gif" format="gif">
		</>
	</>
</>

<para>
This lays out a module with two package directories.  The first, 
com.example.snood contains the class <filename>SnoodClient.java</>,
the interface <filename>ISnood.java</> and a resource file: <filename>SnoodClient.properties</>.  
The second package, com.example.snood.server contains the class <filename>SnoodImpl.java</>.</>

<para>A module makefile must provide a name for the module 
(which is used to name the JAR or WAR file) and a list of packages.  
It may provide additional options used when compiling, generating Javadoc or installing the JAR.</>

<para>The module directory doesn't have to be the source code root, 
by setting the <varname>SOURCE_DIR</> variable, the source code root directory can be moved to 
another location.  Many developers prefer to put the Java source code in a directory named "src". 
In other situations, the Java source code may be in a sibling directory to the module directory.</>

<para>In our example, the module directory is also the root source code directory, 
so the <filename>Makefile</> is very simple:
</>

<example>
	<title>Makefile</>
	<programlisting>PROJECT_NAME = Snood

PACKAGES = \
	com.example.snood \
	com.example.snood.server

include $(SYS_MAKEFILE_DIR)/Jar.mk</>
	</example>

<para>The last line module for this project as Jar; a module that builds a JAR file from the project.</>

<para>The other two Makefiles identify the Java source files in the package, 
any resource files that should be copied into the JAR, and any classes that must be compiled with the 
RMI compiler.
</>

<example>
	<title>com/example/snood/Makefile</>
	<programlisting>JAVA_FILES = *.java

RESOURCE_FILES = *.properties

include $(SYS_MAKEFILE_DIR)/Package.mk

com/example/snood/server/Makefile
JAVA_FILES = *.java

RMI_CLASSES = SnoodImpl

include $(SYS_MAKEFILE_DIR)/Package.mk</>
	</example>

<para>
Building this module executes a sequence of commands:</>

<screen><prompt>D:/Temp/Snood&gt;</><userinput>make</> 

*** Cataloging package com.example.snood ... ***


*** Cataloging package com.example.snood.server ... ***


*** Compiling ... ***

C:/jdk1.3/bin/javac.exe -d .build/classes -classpath "D:/Temp/Snood;D:/Temp/Snood/.build/classes" com/example/snood/ISnood.java com/example/snood/SnoodClient.java com/example/snood/server/SnoodImpl.java

*** Compiling RMI stubs and skeletons ... ***

C:/jdk1.3/bin/rmic.exe -d .build/classes -classpath "D:/Temp/Snood;D:/Temp/Snood/.build/classes" \
	   com.example.snood.server.SnoodImpl

*** Copying package resources ...***

Copying: SnoodClient.properties

*** Building Snood.jar ... ***

C:/jdk1.3/bin/jar.exe cf Snood.jar -C .build/classes .
</screen>

<para>When a project is first built, the JBE catalogs the Java source files, resource files 
and RMI classes in the packages (this information is kept for subsequent makes ).  
It then uses this information to perform all the remaining work from the module directory.</>

<para>Here it compiled all the Java files in one pass, 
built the RMI stubs and skeletons, then copied resource files, 
and created the final JAR file. On a subsequent build, 
only files which had changed since the previous build 
would be recompiled or re-copied.</>

<para>You can also see that full pathnames are used to access 
the various GNU and JDK tools.  This ensures that the correct JDK is used.  
It also means the tools are available, even if the user hasn't added the JDK's 
<filename class=directory>bin</>
directory to the system <envar>PATH</>.</>

<para>The JBE creates a <filename class=directory>.build</> directory in the project directory  
and directs compilation to this directory as well as copying resource files into it.  
It just becomes a matter of using the JDK <command>jar</> tool to create a JAR from the directory.  
WARs are generated the same way (but with a different structure).</>

<para>The <varname>RMI_CLASSES</> is simply a list of the class names of RMI implementation classes; 
just the simple name of the class (no extension, and no package name; the package is known implicitly).</>

<para>Package makefiles are optional, if not provided a default makefile is used.

<para>
A War module is similar to a Jar module, except that the final file has the extension 
".war" instead of ".jar" and the internal layout is different. 
A Web Application Archive (WAR) is a file that can be deployed into a 
J2EE application server; it contains servlets and other Java code as well 
as context resources (images and other assets that are part of the web application).</>

<para>In a WAR, classes are stored in the directory <filename class=directory>WEB-INF/classes</>, 
rather than at the root.  Context resources go in the root of the WAR 
(these are images and other files that are accessible by the client web browser).  
There will deployment descriptor files that must also be copied from the

		<title>WebLogic modules</>

<para>The WebLogic module type is a specialization of the 
Jar module used to create deployable EJB JARS for use with the 
WebLogic application server version 5.1.  
To use it, the <varname>WEBLOGIC_DIR</> variable must be set, usually in <filename>LocalConfig.mk</>.
</>

<para>Unless overriden, WebLogic modules are always compiled using Sun's JDK 1.2.2.</>

<para>The libraries <filename class=directory><replaceable>WEBLOGIC_DIR</>/classes</>
and <filename class=directory><replaceable>WEBLOGIC_DIR</>/lib/weblogicaux.jar</>
are automatically added to the classpath.  
These add WebLogic's implementations of the J2EE frameworks (JNDI, EJB, etc.).</>

<para>For the most part, WebLogic modules work the same as Jar modules.  
However, the jar rule is changed to not only build the normal JAR, but also build the 
depoyable JAR.  
It does this by running the WebLogic <command>ejbc</> command, which provides all the 
WebLogic specific classes needed to deploy (such as stubs and skeletons for EJBs, and 
a variety of files to support container managed persistence).</>

<para>The deployable JAR is called <filename><replaceable>PROJECT_NAME</>-deploy.jar</>.  
The install rule copies <emphasis>both</> JARs to the <varname>INSTALL_DIR</> directory.</>

<para>JAR files in the <varname>PROJ_CLASSPATH</> are treated as dependencies 
of the deployable JAR.  If any of them change, then the deployable JAR is rebuilt 
(using <command>ejbc</>).</>

<para>The WebLogic module automatically adds the files 
<filename>ejb-jar.xml</> (the generic EJB deployment descriptor) and 
<filename>weblogic-ejb-jar.xml</> (the WebLogic specific EJB deployment descriptor) 
to the list of <varname>META_RESOURCES</> (files copied to the 
<filename class=directory>META-INF</> directory of the JAR).

		<title>jBoss modules</>

<para>jBoss is an open-source J2EE application server available from http://www.ejboss.org/.</>

<para>The jBoss module type is a specialization of the Jar type used to create EJB JARS for 
use with the jBoss.  jBoss is easier to work with than WebLogic, since it doesn't require the 
creation of stubs and skeletons, and deployment is as simple as copying the JAR file to 
a predetermined directory.</>

<para>The <varname>JBOSS_DIR</> variable must be set, usually in <filename>LocalConfig.mk</>.
This is the directory into which the jBoss distribution was installed.</>

<para>The following libraries are automatically included in the classpath:
</>

<simplelist>
	<member>
		<filename><replaceable>JBOSS_DIR</>/lib/ext/ejb.jar</>
	</>
	<member>
		<filename><replaceable>JBOSS_DIR</>/lib/ext/jndi.jar</>
	</>
	<member>
		<filename><replaceable>JBOSS_DIR</>/lib/jdbc2_0-stdext.jar</>
	</>
</simplelist>

<para>
These three libraries provide the basic J2EE functionality.  
<filename>ejb.jar</> provides the <classname>javax.ejb</> classes, 
<filename>jndi.jar</> provides the <classname>javax.naming</> classes
and <filename>jbdc2_0-stdext.jar</> provides the <classname>javax.sql</> classes.
</>

<para>
For the most part, jBoss modules work the same as Jar modules.
The jBoss module automatically adds the file 
<filename>ejb-jar.xml</> (the generic EJB deployment descriptor) 
to the list of <varname>META_RESOURCES</>
files copied to the <filename class=directory>META-INF</> directory of the JAR).  
If you use the auxilliary descriptor files (<filename>jboss.xml</> and/or 
<filename>jaws.xml</>) you'll need to manually add those to <varname>META_RESOURCES</>.
