	<title>The Tapestry Inspector</>

<para>
Tapestry includes a powerful tool: the Inspector, which reveals the construction 
of a running Tapestry application. 
</>

<para>
The <classname>ShowInspector</> component is used to include a link that 
launches the Inspector.  This is typically included in the navigational border of an 
application, so that it is available to the developer from any page.  The 
Inspector itself is a page that is provided by the framework and available to 
any Tapestry application.
