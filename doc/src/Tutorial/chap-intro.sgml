<para>
Tapestry is a new application framework developed at Primix.
</>

<para>
Tapestry uses a component object model to represent the pages of a web application.  This is 
similar to spirit to using the Java Swing component object model to build GUIs.
</>

<para>
Just like using a GUI toolkit, there's some preparation and some basic ideas that must be cleared 
before going to more ambitious things.  Nobody writes a word processor off the top of their head 
as their first GUI project; nobody should attempt a full-featured e-commerce site as their first 
attempt using Tapestry.
</>

<para>
The goal of Tapestry is to eliminate most of the coding in a web application.  Under Tapestry, 
nearly all code is directly related to application functionality, with very little "plumbing".  If you 
have previously developed a web application using Microsoft Active Server Pages, JavaServer 
Pages or Java Servlets, you may take for granted all the plumbing:  writing servlets, assembling 
URLs, parsing URLs, managing objects inside the <classname>HttpSession</>, etc.
</>

<para>
Tapestry takes care of nearly all of that, for free.  It allows for the development of rich, highly 
interactive applications.
</>

<para>
This tutorial will start with basic concepts, such as the "Hello World" application, and will 
gradually build up to more sophisticated examples.
</>

<para>
The tutorial uses <command>Jetty</>, a freely available servlet engine, which is packaged with 
the Tapestry 
distribution.
</>

<para>
The format of this tutorial is to describe (visually and with text) an application within the tutorial, 
then describe how it is constructed, using code excerpts.  The reader is best served by having an 
IDE open so that they can look at the code in detail, as well as run the applications.
