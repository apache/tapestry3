<para>
The preceding chapters cover many of the basic aspects of Tapestry.  You should be comfortable 
with basic Tapestry concepts:

	<listitem>
		<para>How components wrap each other, allowing for the creation of very complicated 
		components through aggregation

		<para>
		Different types of page properties (transient, dynamic, persistent)

<para>
Tapestry is capable of quite a bit more.  Also available within the Tapestry Examples package 
(along with the tutorial code and this document) is the Primix Virtual Library application (Vlib).
</>

<para>
Vlib is a full-blown J2EE application, that makes use of Tapestry as its front end, and a set of 
session and entity Enterprise JavaBeans as its back end.
</>

<para>
Vlib also demonstrates some of the other aspects of developing a Tapestry application.  It shows 
how to create pages that are bookmarkable (meaning that their URL includes enough information 
to reconstruct them in a subsequent session).  It shows how to handle logging in to an application, 
and how to protect pages from being accessed until the user is logged in.  It has many specialized 
reusable components for creating links to pages about books and people.
