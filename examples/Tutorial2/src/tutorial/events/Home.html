<h1>A simple Generic Link</h1>
Click <span jwcid="google">here</span> to perform a search at Google.

<h1>ActionLink and DirectLink</h1>
<p>
This <span jwcid="direct">direct link</span> will get the time of day,
save it in a variable of the page, and show it underneath this paragraph
using a InsertText component.
</p>

<p>
This <span jwcid="action">action link</span> will do the same thing
as the direct link (it uses the same listener method). If you would like
to observe the difference in processing, run this example from a console
prompt with debug enabled. The listener method will output the string
<pre>"TIME LISTENER METHOD CALLED"</pre>. You will notice 
the place in the render cycle in which the method is called is different
depending upon the link type that you click.
