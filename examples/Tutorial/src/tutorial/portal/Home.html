<h1>Tapestry tutorial:  Simulated Portal</h1>

<p>This tutorial shows how to build a data-driven Portal application using Tapestry.

<p>At the bottom of the page is a drop down list for adding new content to this page.

<p>The content is provided by other pages within the application.  However, the content
doesn't have to be simple HTML ... it can be Tapestry components, even forms and links.

<p>Each "Portlet" can be maximized (showing its content) 
or minimized (showing just its title) independently, using the bar/box icon in the
upper right corner.  To remove a Portlet 
from the page, just click its close button (the red X).

<p>Don't forget to click the inspector (at the bottom of the page) to see how
this application is constructed!
