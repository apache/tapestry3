This is a static page, forwarded to from a Tapestry listener method.

<p>
Note that internal resources are <em>forwarded to</em>, not
<em>redirected to</em>.  Tapestry uses 
<code>RequestDispatcher.forward(ServletRequest, ServletResponse)</code>
for internal resources (this is the same way an ordinary servlet would
forward to a JSP to render a response).

<p>
The only downside of this is that the URL for this "page" is complex, typically
something like:

<blockquote>
http://localhost[:8080]/tutorial/workbench/direct/Redirect/internal
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes it awkward to create relative paths (at least in static HTML).
This is less of an issue in a JSP, since it can write a dynamic
&lt;base&gt; tag (the same way Tapestry does)
to allow easy relative paths.
