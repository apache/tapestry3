  The concept of the Virtual Library application is to treat all the people in an organization
   (for example, a company, a department, or a neighborhood) as a distributed, virtual library. 
   Everyone shares their books with everyone else.</p>
   
   <p>The application
   tracks where books are.  When you borrow a book, you tell the application; when you return a book, 
   you tell the
   application.  When you need a book, you search in the application. </p>
   
   <p>
   This can be very cost effective ... it allows
   you to share your books rather than purchase duplicate copies and keeps track of the
   books so they don't get lost.

<p>The Virtual Library is a modest J2EE application that
uses Tapestry for its presentation layer.
The Virtual Library has no database access in the presentation layer; it is all done
using a mix of stateful and stateless sessions beans, plus some entity beans (using container-managed persistance).
The application layer executes within the  <a href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</a> application server,
but could easily be ported to other servers.  The Virtual Library is not only a good example of a Tapestry 
application, it's a good example of a J2EE application.
